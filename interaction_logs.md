# 🤖 Interaction Logs — Use of LLMs During Development

This document records my interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) — ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) — which I used to assist in the research, documentation, and preparation of my **TinyAgent** project for the internship assignment.

The purpose of these interactions was to:
- Understand agent orchestration and LoRA fine-tuning concepts.  
- Generate README documentation, architecture explanation, and data-science report.  
- Create professional interaction log examples and submission guidance.

## 🧠 Session 1 — Understanding the Task
**Prompt:**  
> Can we do one thing as a student body member we have to send multiple mails to different individuals... can I implement this and how can I get the data for LoRA-based fine tuning?

**AI Response Summary:**  
The model explained how LoRA fine-tuning can personalize small language models for domain-specific automation (e.g., sending mails to specific groups) and how to gather structured datasets for training.

**Outcome:**  
Helped me understand how AI agents can filter communication by category (department, year, etc.) and how LoRA tuning can be applied to smaller models.

## ⚙️ Session 2 — Selecting a Base Repository
**Prompt:**  
> Suggest already developed GitHub repos for this assignment complete with all required files.

**AI Response Summary:**  
The AI listed open-source projects (like TinyAgent, Kaymen personal-assistant, and similar LoRA-based agent frameworks) that could serve as educational reference material.

**Outcome:**  
Identified **TinyAgent** as the most relevant reference for this project.

## 🧩 Session 3 — Understanding TinyAgent Repository
**Prompt:**  
> I want a GitHub repo which contains the agent orchestration for any task that uses a fine-tuned model.

**AI Response Summary:**  
The AI analyzed repositories like **SqueezeAILab/TinyAgent**, describing their structure (agent core, tool calling, retriever modules, and LoRA integration).

**Outcome:**  
Enabled me to reuse and document the backend part of TinyAgent for demonstration purposes.

## 🧱 Session 4 — Building My Own Project Structure
**Prompt:**  
> I have deleted the app segment as I don't want that. My folder structure is shown in the image. Create a proper README with architecture document and data science report.

**AI Response Summary:**  
The AI generated a detailed README.md including:
- AI agent architecture explanation  
- Interaction flow diagram (text-based)  
- Data-science report (fine-tuning setup, evaluation, and results)

**Outcome:**  
This became the final **README.md** for my GitHub submission.

---

## 🗂️ Session 5 — Clarifying Repository Files
**Prompt:**  
> Can you tell me what is the use of TinyAgent.zip file that I stored in the repo?

**AI Response Summary:**  
The AI explained that `TinyAgent.zip` was a compiled macOS app bundle used for running TinyAgent locally — a packaged version for edge AI testing.

**Outcome:**  
I removed the `.zip` file since the assignment required only backend and documentation components.

## 💬 Session 6 — Generating Interaction Logs (for AI Agent)
**Prompt:**  
> Create a professional interaction log showing how the agent performs daily tasks like scheduling, emailing, and summarizing.

**AI Response Summary:**  
The AI produced a 5-example, human-readable log covering:
- Calendar scheduling  
- Email automation  
- Research paper summarization  
- To-do list updates  
- File search and summarization  

**Outcome:**  
Used as my official `interaction_logs.md` deliverable.

---

## 📤 Session 7 — Submission Preparation
**Prompt:**  
> Please give me the steps to complete all these and submit on GitHub.

**AI Response Summary:**  
The AI listed step-by-step actions:
1. Create repo on GitHub.  
2. Upload all files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `src/`, `interaction_logs.md`).  
3. Commit changes.  
4. Send notification email with repo URL.  

**Outcome:**  
Used these exact steps to prepare my final submission.

## 🧾 Reflection
Working with ChatGPT helped me:
- Learn structured prompt-based development for AI agents.  
- Understand how LoRA fine-tuning enables lightweight edge AI models.  
- Produce clean, consistent documentation for academic submission.

All generated outputs were **reviewed, customized, and verified** by me before inclusion in my final project.
